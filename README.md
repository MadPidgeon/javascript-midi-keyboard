# javascript-midi-keyboard
Me playing around with the MIDI-support of my browser.
It allows you to connect with a MIDI-device to a server much like a chat system.
A board/room system is yet to be implemented.

Uses NodeJS, requiring express and socket.io.
Furthermore relies on JQuery (https://github.com/jquery/jquery) and js-cookie (https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie).
